      <h2>Minimum metadata (small-institution baseline)</h2>
      <p>
        Metadata is how someone else (or future you) can understand what the asset is, where it came from, and what they’re
        allowed to do with it.
      </p>

      <h3>Minimum fields (recommended)</h3>
      <pre class="codeblock"><code>object_id
title
creator/operator
date_created
physical_object_or_site (what was scanned)
capture_method (photogrammetry / LiDAR / structured light)
device(s)
software + version(s)
units + scale reference
file list (what belongs to this package)
rights + license
access level (public / internal / restricted)
preservation master format + location
derivatives format + location
processing notes (paradata)

      <h2>Paradata: document the decisions</h2>
      <p>
        A 3D model is shaped by cleanup, meshing, decimation, and export settings. Paradata is the record of those decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>Paradata checklist (plain language)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What did you remove or change (noise cleanup, hole filling, smoothing)?</li>
        <li>Did you decimate or simplify? If yes, how aggressively?</li>
        <li>Did you change textures (resolution, compression, re-bake)?</li>
        <li>What exports were produced and why (preservation vs access)?</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>DPC 3D preservation note:</strong>

      <h2>FAIR and CARE (what they mean here)</h2>

      <h3>FAIR</h3>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>FAIR authors (Wilkinson et al., 2016):</strong>
        <blockquote>“Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability…”</blockquote>
        <p class="note">
          For Sustain 3D, FAIR means: consistent IDs, clear metadata, documented formats, and stated reuse conditions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>CARE</h3>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>RDA (CARE Principles one-pager):</strong>
        <blockquote>“authority to control such data be empowered.”</blockquote>
        <p class="note">
          CARE matters when objects involve community authority, cultural protocols, or sensitive materials.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Practical use</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>FAIR: make the asset discoverable and usable with enough description and structure.</li>
        <li>CARE: clearly record restrictions, community authority, and ethical conditions for reuse.</li>
      </ul>
