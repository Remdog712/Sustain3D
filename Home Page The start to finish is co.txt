Home Page: The "start to finish is confusing". Please make the steps bigger and more visible and move it smartly onto the Workflow page possibly connected into the "Workflow Overview" section and connect that better to "Phase Markers"; Remove "Explore the framework" section


Workflow: Remove text "Easy Path"; Remove "Jump to the exact how to pages";  Please make the the "Phase Markers" section and their colors tie and link directly to their according PIPs and title them the same.; Please add a section that describes the whole workflow in bullet points "I have created a repository..." that works as a checklist. 

note: Incorporate "Repository Setup" into this project (probably with Before you scan" and make it a step of the workflow.

Files: Make it easier to follow, use more colors to differeniate area. Make the sources and file templates less important

Metadata: See if you can explain how metadata is edited in a general sense
