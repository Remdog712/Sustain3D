Make sure the workflow covers a step by step guide and is easily to visually follow. Most users will only use this page


For resources, any time that word from the glossary is mentioned in other pages, have an option to click the word and have it show the definition by taking them to the glossary

For all of the pages, check each for a logical flow and move things around accordingly so that it each section is visually different and add an different outline texture or shape to the boxes that are showing examples or templates

also uses sources at the bottom as possible from the thesis essay but make it very lowkey at the bottom, nothing flashy. 

Make the goal section box of each page be filled with the color of the page so it looks different and adjust the text to match. 

Make the Follow the Sequence on each page a little smaller and only say (You are on: _____  Next: _____) and remove the "Start Here" part

On the policies page, create an example filled out policy template



For files, cover these topics with templates and explanations: When One Machine Has Multiple Parts

You have two valid structural models:

Object-centric

Project-centric

For a complex object (like a machine with multiple components), you need both hierarchy and assembly logic.

Recommended Structure: Object with Parts Subfolder

If the machine is the intellectual “thing” you care about long-term:

Objects/
  Mechanical/
    WaterPump_001/
      assembly/
        WaterPump_001_master_assembly_v01.pres.obj
        assembly_metadata.txt
      parts/
        WP001_P01_Impeller/
        WP001_P02_Housing/
        WP001_P03_Shaft/
      documentation/
        metadata.txt
        paradata.txt
        rights_and_access.txt

Each part then gets the same internal structure:

WP001_P01_Impeller/
  01_raw/
  02_processing/
  03_preservation/
  04_access/
  documentation/
Why this works

The machine is a parent object

Parts are children objects

Each part remains independently preservable

The assembly model defines how they fit together

This mirrors how digital preservation literature stresses preserving all variations and intermediate files, not just the final asset 

3D Data Long-Term Preservation …

.

Naming Convention for Parts

Use a consistent part code:

WaterPump_001_P01_Impeller
WaterPump_001_P02_Housing

Structure:

[ParentID]_P[##]_[PartName]

If order matters physically, use sequential numbering.
If order doesn’t matter, use functional labels.

2️⃣ What If You Don’t Know the Name?

Never invent a false authoritative name.

Use one of these:

Option A – Descriptive Placeholder
InsectSpecimen_045_unknown_wing_fragment
Machine_002_unknown_component_A
Option B – Functional Description
Machine_002_rotating_disc_component
Artifact_014_small_curved_metal_piece
Option C – Controlled Placeholder
UnknownObject_001
Unidentified_Component_003

Then clarify in metadata:

identified_as: unknown
suspected_function: ventilation coupling
confidence_level: low
identified_by: J. Orange
date_identified: 2026-02-20

This aligns with the emphasis on provenance and documentation in 3D preservation workflows

The key rule:
File names describe what you know. Metadata describes uncertainty.

3️⃣ How Do You Represent That Parts Fit Together?

This is where people usually fail.

File structure alone is not enough.

You need:

Structural hierarchy

Assembly metadata

Relationship documentation

A. Assembly Folder

Inside the parent object:

assembly/
  WaterPump_001_master_assembly_v01.pres.obj
  assembly_relationships.json
B. Relationship Metadata (Critical)

Example: assembly_relationships.json

{
  "parent_object": "WaterPump_001",
  "parts": [
    {
      "id": "WP001_P01_Impeller",
      "connects_to": "WP001_P03_Shaft",
      "connection_type": "rotational_fit",
      "alignment_reference": "central_axis"
    },
    {
      "id": "WP001_P02_Housing",
      "contains": "WP001_P01_Impeller",
      "connection_type": "enclosure"
    }
  ]
}

This is far better than trying to encode relationships only in filenames.

C. Cross-Reference in Each Part’s Metadata

Inside WP001_P01_Impeller/documentation/metadata.txt:

parent_object: WaterPump_001
part_number: P01
assembly_position: internal rotating component
fits_with: WP001_P03_Shaft

This creates bidirectional traceability.

Preservation literature repeatedly stresses that preserving the object without preserving its contextual relationships weakens long-term reuse

4️⃣ When to Use Project vs Object Structure

If the machine was scanned as part of a larger site survey:

Projects/
  FactorySurvey_2026/
    Machine_12_WaterPump/

But still maintain a mirrored object entry in:

Objects/Mechanical/

Projects document workflow.
Objects document long-term intellectual identity.

Do not collapse those into one folder. That’s where repositories become unusable after 5 years.

5️⃣ Summary: Clean Rules
Rule 1

Every physical thing = one object folder.

Rule 2

Every removable or distinct component = child object.

Rule 3

Assemblies define relationships, not filenames.

Rule 4

Unknown things get descriptive placeholders + documented uncertainty.

Rule 5

Projects record workflow; Objects record identity.
