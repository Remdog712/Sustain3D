# Welcome to My Schreyer Honors 3D Project

Thank you for visiting!  
This project explores the combination of **3D scanning, digital preservation, and immersive storytelling** through the lens of **art, history, and technology**.

As part of my work with the **Schreyer Honors College at Penn State Behrend**, I’ve combined advanced 
3D scanning techniques with creative digital media to document and reimagine real-world objects and environments. 
The goal is to make history, culture, and design more **accessible, interactive, and sustainable** in digital form.
